# SENSORS
## 1. TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY MODULE
**Introduction**

In this tutorial we will learn how to use a DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor.
Itâ€™s accurate enough for most projects that need to keep track of humidity and
temperature readings.
Again we will be using a Library specifically designed for these sensors that will make our
code short and easy to write.

**Components**
- 1 * Arduino Uno board
- 1 * USB cable
- 1 * temp and humidity module
- Jumper wires(Female to Male)

**Principles**

**Experimental Procedures**

**Step 1:**  Connect circuit as shown in the following photo:

As you can see we only need 3 connections to the sensor, since one of the pin is not used.
The connection are : Voltage, Ground and Signal which can be connected to any Analog
Pin on our UNO.

**Step 2:**  Press Ctrl+Shift+I to go to the manage libraries section in your Arduino IDE.Then search for DHT11 in the searchbox.
Install the **DHT sensor library by Adafruit** along with all the dependecies from there:

**Step 3:**   Now go to **Files-->Examples-->DHT Sensor library** and select any one of the two example codes:

**Step 4:**  Now compile the program by clicking on the **Verify** button or by pressing **Ctrl+R**.

**Step 5:**  Now upload the program on you Arduino Board by clicking on the **Upload** button or by pressing **Ctrl+U**.

**Step 6:**  Open the **tools-->Serial Monitor**, then you can see the humidity and temperature.
