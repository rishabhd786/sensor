# SENSORS
## 1. BMP180 BAROMETRIC SENSOR
**Introduction**

In this tutorial we will learn how to use a BMP180 Barometric Sensor.
It measures the absolute pressure of the air around it. It has a measuring range from
300hPa to 1100hPa with an accuracy down to 0.02hPa. It can also measure altitude
and temperature.
The BMP180 barometric sensor communicates via I2C interface. This means that it
communicates with the Arduino using just 2 pins.

**Components**
- 1 * Arduino Uno board
- 1 * USB cable
- 1 * BMP180 Barometric Sensor
- Jumper wires(Female to Male)

**Principles**

**Experimental Procedures**

**Step 1:**  Connect circuit as shown in the following photo:

**Step 2:**  Press Ctrl+Shift+I to go to the manage libraries section in your Arduino IDE.Then search for BMP180 in the searchbox.
Install the **Adafruit BMP085 library** along with all the dependecies from there:

**Step 4:**  Now compile the program by clicking on the **Verify** button or by pressing **Ctrl+R**.

**Step 5:**  Now upload the program on you Arduino Board by clicking on the **Upload** button or by pressing **Ctrl+U**.
